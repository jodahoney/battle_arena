# Welcome to Battle Arena
## Battle Arena is a C++ game that I created as a project for a Computer Science class. 
The game is a tournament between four different classes of creatures; Humans, Elfs, Balrogs, and Cyberdemons.
Each species has it's own advantages and possible range of health and damage abilities.
Feel free to fork and see what sort of outcomes you get!
